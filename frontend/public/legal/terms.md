## 3. YAP Token System and Blockchain Rewards

- **Token Earning and Rewards:** You earn YAP tokens by completing language learning activities, achieving milestones, maintaining streaks, and participating in various features as detailed in our current token reward structure. Token rewards are subject to change at our discretion with reasonable notice to users.
- **Token Spending:** YAP tokens may be spent within the application to access premium features, including but not limited to additional daily lessons, extended AI chat sessions, unit examinations, and special events. Fifty percent of spent tokens are burned, and fifty percent are allocated to the YAP treasury as programmatically enforced at the smart contract level.
- **Wallet Creation and Management:** Your cryptocurrency wallet is created and managed through our third-party provider, Privy.io. You acknowledge that Privy.io operates independently from YAP and has its own terms of service and privacy practices. YAP is not responsible for the security, functionality, or availability of Privy.io services.
- **Token Withdrawal and Lockup Period:** Tokens earned through the Services are subject to a twenty-four (24) hour lockup period before they become eligible for withdrawal to external wallets. This lockup period helps maintain ecosystem stability and prevent fraudulent activity.
- **No Guaranteed Value:** YAP tokens are utility tokens designed for use within the YAP ecosystem. We make no representations or guarantees regarding the monetary value of YAP tokens. Token values may fluctuate significantly, and tokens may have no value outside the Services. You acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency tokens.
- **Beta to Mainnet Conversion:** During beta testing, points earned will be converted to YAP tokens at mainnet launch according to the following formula:  
  `YAP tokens = Points ร ($0.05 per point) รท (Token Generation Event price)`.  
  Conversion rates and mechanisms are subject to our final determination.
