  We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, including Privy.io for wallet services, cloud hosting providers, and analytics services. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.

- **Blockchain Transactions:**  
  Token transactions and wallet addresses are publicly visible on the Sei blockchain. While these transactions are pseudonymous, they may be associated with your identity if your wallet address becomes known.

- **Leaderboards:**  
  If you participate in leaderboards, your username and score may be visible to other users. You may opt out of leaderboard display in your account settings.

- **Legal Requirements:**  
  We may disclose information when required by law, court order, or governmental request, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, prevent fraud, or ensure user safety.

- **Business Transfers:**  
  In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity, subject to the same privacy protections outlined in this policy.

> We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

## 5. Data Retention and Blockchain Permanence

- We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy.
- Upon account termination, we delete or anonymize your personal information within ninety (90) days, except where longer retention is required by law or legitimate business purposes.
- Transaction data and learning progress recorded on the Sei blockchain are permanent and cannot be deleted due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology. This includes token transactions, lesson completion records, and achievement milestones.

We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

- Encryption in transit and at rest
